## Next Steps

1. Implement a build process using Webpack or Gulp

## Benefits of Changes So Far

3. **Cleaner Structure**: Foundation for a more professional theme architecture

## Recommendations for Continued Improvement

1. Consider implementing a CSS preprocessor (SCSS) for better style organization
