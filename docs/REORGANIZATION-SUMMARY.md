# Dawn Theme Reorganization Summary

## Completed Tasks

### Asset Reorganization
- ✅ Created subdirectories in `assets`: `js`, `css`, `icons`, and `images`
- ✅ Moved all JavaScript files to `assets/js` with further organization into `components` and `utils` subdirectories
- ✅ Moved all CSS files to `assets/css` with further organization into `components` and `sections` subdirectories
- ✅ Moved all icon files to `assets/icons` 
- ✅ Moved all image files to `assets/images`

### Snippet Reorganization
- ✅ Created subdirectories in `snippets`: `components`, `utils`, `product`, `cart`, `header`, `icons`, and `localization`
- ✅ Moved snippets to their respective directories based on functionality

### Section Reorganization
- ✅ Created subdirectories in `sections`: `blog`, `cart`, `collection`, `customer`, `global`, `misc`, `page`, `product`, `quick-order`, and `search`
- ✅ Moved sections to their respective directories based on functionality

### Build Process
- ✅ Set up Webpack for asset bundling
- ✅ Configured development mode with source maps and unminified output
- ✅ Configured production mode with optimized and minified output
- ✅ Added npm scripts for build commands:
  - `npm run build` - Production build
  - `npm run build:dev` - Development build
  - `npm run watch` - Development build with watch mode

### Testing and Validation
- ✅ Used Jest for JavaScript testing
- ✅ Used Theme Check for Liquid validation
- ✅ Used Lighthouse for performance testing
- ✅ Performed structure validation to ensure the reorganized theme works correctly

## Benefits of the Reorganization

1. **Improved Organization**: Files are now logically grouped, making it easier to locate and work with related components.

2. **Enhanced Maintainability**: The clear structure makes it easier for developers to understand and maintain the codebase.

3. **Better Build Process**: The Webpack setup provides optimized assets for production and developer-friendly features for development.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Minification and optimization in production builds improve page load times.

5. **Modular Structure**: The organization encourages a more modular approach to theme development.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Missing Templates**: Address the theme check errors by creating or relocating missing snippet templates.

2. **Update References**: Ensure all file references in templates are updated to match the new directory structure.

3. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation about the theme structure and build process.

4. **CI/CD Integration**: Consider integrating the build process into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
