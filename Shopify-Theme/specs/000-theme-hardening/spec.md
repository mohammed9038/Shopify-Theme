## Title
Dawn Theme Hardening & Enhancements

## Problem & Scope
**Problem:** Fix issues in the modified Dawn theme and make it professional and clean using Shopify best practices, while improving core features.  
**Scope:** Header, navigation, theme settings; add Quick View, sticky header, mobile drawer, announcement bar, customizable footer, and settings enhancements (colors, typography, RTL).

## Users & Needs
- **Store Visitors / Customers**
  - Faster loading speeds
  - Clean, intuitive navigation
  - Easy checkout flow
  - Product quick view
  - Mobile-friendly, responsive design
- **Merchants / Admins**
  - Flexible theme settings
  - Drag-and-drop sections
  - Less code editing
  - Localization / multi-language support
- **Theme Developers**
  - Clean, structured codebase
  - Shopify best practices
  - Easy to maintain/extend
  - App compatibility

## User Stories
- As a customer, I want to browse and purchase products in a fast and easy way without facing any complexity.
- As a customer, I want a product quick view so I can see details and add to cart without leaving the collection page.
- As a merchant, I want flexible settings and drag-and-drop sections so I can customize the store without coding.
- As a developer, I want a clean, maintainable codebase aligned with Shopify best practices and compatible with apps.

## Business Goals
- Increase conversion rates
- Improve mobile sales
- Reduce bounce rate
- Enable easier merchant customization

## Constraints
- Shopify platform restrictions (Liquid, OS 2.0, checkout limits)
- Reliance on Dawn theme updates
- Potential conflicts with third-party apps

## Success Metrics
- Faster page load time (Shopify speed score/Lighthouse)
- Higher conversion rate
- Lower bounce rate
- More mobile orders
- Fewer merchant support tickets

## Risks / Dependencies
- Dawn structure changes may require rework
- Third-party app reliance can cause compatibility issues
- Limited testing resources
- RTL/translation complexity

## Out of Scope
- Custom checkout beyond Shopify Checkout extensibility
- Deep Storefront API rewrites (keep to Liquid + minimal Ajax)

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Performance:** LCP ≤ 2.5s on key templates; Lighthouse Perf ≥ 80 mobile; no blocking 3rd-party scripts in critical path.
- **Quick View:** Opens from collection grid, shows images/price/variants, quantity selector, Ajax add-to-cart, closes without route change.
- **Navigation:** Mobile drawer is touch-friendly; desktop menus keyboard-accessible; sticky header doesn't overlap content.
- **Announcement Bar:** Configurable text/link/visibility by page; dismissible option.
- **Footer:** Blocks for menus, socials, payments; reorderable in editor.
- **Settings:** Color tokens & typography scales controlled from settings; RTL toggle available; no hardcoded copy in Liquid.
- **Quality:** No console errors; HTML passes basic accessibility checks (contrast, focus order, aria for menus); passes cross-device smoke tests.
